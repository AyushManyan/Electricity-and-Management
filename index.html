		<h2>Electricity Production by Coal</h2>Coal plays a vital role in electricity generation worldwide. Coal-fired
		power plants currently fuel 37% of global electricity and figures from the IEA show that coal will still
		generate 22% of the world’s electricity in 2040, retaining coal’s position as the single largest source of
		electricity worldwide.
		<br>Coal is typically burned to create steam, which is then piped at high pressure over a turbine, causing it to
		rotate, producing electricity. This steam electric system is a common one also used with other fuel sources,
		including oil, natural gas, geothermal, biomass, and even some solar-fueled systems.
		<br>These emissions spawn the acid rain that is eating away red spruce forests in the Northeast and Appalachia,
		and rob previously pristine streams of brook trout and other fish species in the Adirondacks, upper Midwest and
		Rocky Mountains.
		<br>
		<h2>Solar Plant</h2>Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly
		using photovoltaics (PV) or indirectly using concentrated solar power. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an
		electric current using the photovoltaic effect.[2] Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and
		solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight to a hot spot, often to drive a steam turbine.
		<br>
		Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications,
		from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system.
		Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. Since then, as the cost of solar
		electricity has fallen, grid-connected solar PV systems have grown more or less exponentially. Millions of
		installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations continue to be built, with half of new generation
		capacity being solar in 2021.
		<br>
		<h2>Hyro-power Plant</h2>Hydroelectric power is a renewable energy source which harnesses the power of moving
		water to produce electricity.
		<br> A hydroelectric dam converts the potential energy stored in a water reservoir behind a dam to mechanical
		energy—mechanical energy is also known as kinetic energy. As the water flows down through the dam its kinetic
		energy is used to turn a turbine.
		<br>The generator converts the turbine’s mechanical energy into electricity.

		This electric energy then goes through various transmission processes before it reaches you.

		<h2>What is energy management?</h2>

		<p>"Energy management" is a term that has a number of meanings, but we're mainly concerned with the one that
			relates to saving energy in businesses, public-sector/government organizations, and homes:</p>

		<h3>The energy-saving meaning</h3>

		<p>When it comes to energy saving, <strong>energy management is the process of monitoring, controlling, and
				conserving energy in a building or organization</strong>. Typically this involves the following steps:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Metering your energy consumption and collecting the data.</li>
			<li>Finding opportunities to save energy, and estimating <em>how much</em> energy each opportunity could
				save. You would typically analyze your meter data to find and quantify routine energy waste, and you
				might also investigate the energy savings that you could make by replacing equipment (e.g. lighting) or
				by upgrading your building's insulation.</li>
			<li>Taking action to target the opportunities to save energy (i.e. tackling the routine waste and replacing
				or upgrading the inefficient equipment). Typically you'd start with the best opportunities first.</li>
			<li>Tracking your progress by analyzing your meter data to see how well your energy-saving efforts have
				worked.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>(And then back to step 2, and the cycle continues...)</p>

		<p>To confuse matters, many people use "energy management" to refer specifically to those energy-saving efforts
			that focus on making better use of <em>existing</em> buildings and equipment. Strictly speaking, this limits
			things to the behavioural aspects of energy saving (i.e. encouraging people to use less energy by raising <a
				href="#" title="Read our article on energy awareness">energy awareness</a>), although the use of cheap
			control
			equipment such as timer switches is often included in the definition as well.</p>

		<p>The above four-step process applies either way – it's entirely up to you whether you consider energy-saving
			measures that involve buying new equipment or upgrading building fabric.</p>


		<h3>Other meanings</h3>

			<p class="titled attribution" style="width: 246px;">Photo by <span class="valeriebb">Valerie Everett</span>
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>It's not just about saving energy in buildings – the term "energy management" is also used in other fields:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>It's something that energy suppliers (or utility companies) do to ensure that their power stations and
				renewable energy sources generate enough energy to meet demand (the amount of energy that their
				customers need).</li>
			<li>It's used to refer to techniques for managing and controlling one's own levels of personal energy. We're
				far from qualified to say anything more about this!</li>
			<li>It also has relevance in aviation – it's a skill that aircraft pilots learn in some shape or form. We
				know nothing about aircraft energy management, but we can at least manage a picture of a man on a
				plane...</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Anyway, from now on we will pay no more attention to these other definitions – all further references to
			"energy management" will be to the energy-saving sort described above.</p>


		<h3>Home energy management</h3>

		<p>Whilst energy management has been popular in larger buildings for a long time, it has only recently started
			catching on in homes. Most homeowners aren't even aware of the term, and take more of a haphazard,
			flying-blind approach to reducing their energy consumption...</p>

		<p>But the monitoring- and results-driven approach used by professional energy managers is just as effective in
			the home as it is in larger buildings.</p>

		<p>So, if you're a homeowner looking to save energy, don't be put off by the fact that this article focuses more
			on non-residential buildings. Most of the principles that apply to businesses and other organizations are
			also applicable to homes. Certainly the four-step process introduced above and detailed below is entirely
			applicable to home energy management.</p>


		<p class="backTo"><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>



		<a id="why"></a>
		<h2>Why is it important?</h2>

		<p>Energy management is the key to saving energy in your organization. Much of the importance of energy saving
			stems from the global need to save energy – this global need affects energy prices, emissions targets, and
			legislation, all of which lead to several compelling reasons why you should save energy at your organization
			specifically.</p>

		<h3>The global need to save energy</h3>

		<p>If it wasn't for the global need to save energy, the term "energy management" might never have even been
			coined... Globally we need to save energy in order to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Reduce the damage that we're doing to our planet, Earth. As a human race we would probably find things
				rather difficult without the Earth, so it makes good sense to try to make it last.</li>
			<li>Reduce our dependence on the fossil fuels that are becoming increasingly limited in supply.</li>
		</ul>

				Dooley</span></p>
		<p class="fig-title"><label for="wind-turbines">Wind turbines can only do so much – we humans use a <em>lot</em>
				of energy!</label></p>


		<h3>Controlling and reducing energy consumption at your organization</h3>

		<p>Energy management is the means to controlling and reducing your organization's energy consumption... And
			controlling and reducing your organization's energy consumption is important because it enables you to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Reduce costs</strong> – this is becoming increasingly important as energy costs rise.</li>
			<li><strong>Reduce carbon emissions</strong> and the environmental damage that they cause – as well as the
				cost-related implications of carbon taxes and the like, your organization may be keen to reduce its
				carbon footprint to promote a green, sustainable image. Not least because promoting such an image is
				often good for the bottom line.</li>
			<li><strong>Reduce risk</strong> – the more energy you consume, the greater the risk that energy price
				increases or supply shortages could seriously affect your profitability, or even make it impossible for
				your business/organization to continue. With energy management you can reduce this risk by
				<em>reducing</em> your demand for energy and by <em>controlling</em> it so as to make it more
				<em>predictable</em>.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>On top of these reasons, it's quite likely that you have some rather aggressive energy-consumption-reduction
			targets that you're supposed to be meeting at some worrying point in the near future... Your understanding
			of <em>effective</em> energy management will hopefully be the secret weapon that will enable you to meet
			those aggressive targets...</p>

		<p class="backTo"><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


		<a id="how"></a>
		<h2>How best to manage your energy consumption?</h2>

		<p>We identified four steps to the energy-management process above. We'll cover each of them in turn:</p>

		<h3>1. Metering your energy consumption and collecting the data</h3>

		<p>As a rule of thumb: the more data you can get, and the more detailed it is, the better.</p>

		<p>The old school approach to energy-data collection is to manually read meters once a week or once a month.
			This is quite a chore, and weekly or monthly data isn't nearly as good the data that comes easily and
			automatically from the modern approach...</p>

		<p>The modern approach to energy-data collection is to fit interval-metering systems that automatically measure
			and record energy consumption at short, regular intervals such as every 15-minutes or half hour. There's
			more about this on <a href="#">our page about interval data</a>.</p>

		<p>Detailed interval energy consumption data makes it possible to see patterns of energy waste that it would be
			impossible to see otherwise. For example, there's simply no way that weekly or monthly meter readings can
			show you how much energy you're using at different <em>times of the day</em>, or on different <em>days of
				the week</em>. And seeing these patterns makes it much easier to find the routine waste in your
			building.</p>

		<!--<p>The crux of the matter is that it rarely makes economic sense to spend time trying to squeeze useful information out of weekly or monthly meter readings when interval metering is readily available, and the detail from interval-metering systems opens up so many more opportunities to save energy.</p>-->


		<h3 id="step2">2. Finding and quantifying opportunities to save energy</h3>

		<p>The detailed meter data that you are collecting will be invaluable for helping you to find and quantify
			energy-saving opportunities. We've written an article that explains more about how to analyze your meter
			data to <a href="#">find energy waste</a>.</p>

		<p>The easiest and most cost-effective energy-saving opportunities typically require little or no capital
			investment.</p>

		<p>For example, an unbelievable number of buildings have advanced control systems that could, and should, be
			controlling HVAC well, but, unbeknown to the facilities-management staff, are faulty or misconfigured, and
			consequently committing such sins as heating or cooling an empty building every night and every weekend.</p>

		<p><i>(NB "HVAC" is just an industry acronym for <strong>H</strong>eating, <strong>V</strong>entilation and
				<strong>A</strong>ir <strong>C</strong>onditioning. It's a term that's more widely used in some
				countries than others.)</i></p>

		<p>And one of the simplest ways to save a significant amount of energy is to encourage staff to switch equipment
			off at the end of each working day.</p>

		<p>Looking at detailed interval energy data is the ideal way to find routine energy waste. You can check whether
			staff and timers are switching things off without having to patrol the building day and night, and, with a
			little detective work, you can usually figure out who or what is causing the energy wastage that you will
			inevitably find.</p>

		<img class="titled put-center" src="./resources/labelled-energy-waste3.png" id="interval-data-plot"
			title="Detailed energy data is the key to finding the easiest energy savings"
			alt="Detailed energy data is the key to finding the easiest energy savings" width="495" height="227">
		<p class="fig-title"><label for="interval-data-plot">Detailed energy data is the key to finding the easiest
				energy savings<br>(chart created using <a href="#">Energy Lens
					software</a>)</label></p>

		<p>And, using your detailed interval data, it's usually pretty easy to make reasonable estimates of how much
			energy is being wasted at different times. For example, if you've identified that a lot of energy is being
			wasted by equipment left on over the weekends, you can:</p>

		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li>Use your interval data to calculate how much energy (in kWh) is being <em>used</em> each weekend.</li>
			<li>Estimate the proportion of that energy that is being <em>wasted</em> (by equipment that should be
				switched off).</li>
			<li>Using the figures from a and b, calculate an estimate of the total kWh that are wasted each weekend.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Alternatively, if you have no idea of the proportion of energy that is being wasted by equipment left on
			unnecessarily, you could:</p>
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
			<li>Walk the building one evening to ensure that everything that <em>should</em> be switched off <em>is</em>
				switched off.</li>
			<li>Look back at the data for that evening to see how many kW were being used <em>after</em> you switched
				everything off.</li>
			<li>Subtract the <em>target</em> kW figure (ii) from the <em>typical</em> kW figure for weekends to estimate
				the potential savings in kW (power).</li>
			<li>Multiply the kW savings by the number of hours over the weekend to get the total potential kWh energy
				savings for a weekend.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Also, most buildings have open to them a variety of equipment- or building-fabric-related energy-saving
			opportunities, most of which require a more significant capital investment. You are probably aware of many
			of these, such as upgrading insulation or replacing lighting equipment, but good places to look for ideas
			include the <a href="#" title="Visit the Carbon Trust website">Carbon Trust</a>
			and <a href="#" title="Visit the Energy Star website">Energy Star</a>
			websites.</p>

		<p>Although your detailed meter data won't necessarily help you to <em>find</em> these equipment- or
			building-fabric-related opportunities (e.g. it won't tell you that a more efficient type of lighting
			equipment exists), it will be useful for helping you to <em>quantify</em> the potential savings that each
			opportunity could bring. It's much more reliable to base your savings estimates on real metered data than on
			rules of thumb alone. And it's critically important to quantify the expected savings for any opportunity
			that you are considering investing a lot of time or money into – it's the only way you can figure out how to
			hone in on the biggest, easiest energy savings first.</p>


		<h3>3. Targeting the opportunities to save energy</h3>

		<p>Just <em>finding</em> the opportunities to save energy won't help you to save energy – you have to take
			action to target them...</p>

		<p>For those energy-saving opportunities that require you to motivate the people in your building, our article
			on <a href="#">energy awareness</a> should be useful. It
			can be hard work, but, if you can get the people on your side, you can make some seriously big energy
			savings without investing anything other than time.</p>

		<p>As for those energy-saving opportunities that require you to upgrade equipment or insulation: assuming you've
			identified them, there's little more to be said. Just keep your fingers crossed that you make your
			anticipated savings, and be thankful that you don't work for the sort of organization that won't invest in
			anything with a payback period over 6 months.</p>

				this...</label></p>
		<!--<p class="fig-title"><label for="insulation">Let's hope he's not planning on leaving it like that...</label></p>-->


		<h3>4. Tracking your progress at saving energy</h3>

		<p>Once you've taken action to save energy, it's important that you find out how effective your actions have
			been:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Energy savings that come from behavioural changes (e.g. getting people to switch off their computers
				before going home) need ongoing attention to ensure that they remain effective and achieve their maximum
				potential.</li>
			<li>If you've invested money into new equipment, you'll probably want to <em>prove</em> that you've achieved
				the energy savings you predicted.</li>
			<li>If you've corrected faulty timers or control-equipment settings, you'll need to keep checking back to
				ensure that everything's still working as it should be. Simple things like a power cut can easily cause
				timers to revert back to factory settings – if you're not keeping an eye on your energy-consumption
				patterns you can easily miss such problems.</li>
			<li>If you've been given energy-saving targets from above, you'll need to provide evidence that you're
				meeting them, or at least making progress towards that goal...</li>
			<li>And occasionally you might need to prove that progress <em>isn't</em> being made (e.g. if you're at your
				wits' end trying to convince the decision makers to invest some <em>money</em> into your
				energy-management drive).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Our article on <a href="#">energy-performance
				tracking</a> explains how best to analyze your metered energy data to see how well you're making
			progress at saving energy. Like step 2, this step is one that our <a href="#">Energy Lens software</a> has
			been specifically designed to help with.
		</p>


		<h3>Managing your energy consumption effectively is an ongoing process...</h3>

		<p>At the very least you should keep analyzing your energy data regularly to check that things aren't getting
			<em>worse</em>. It's pretty normal for unwatched buildings to become <em>less</em> efficient with time: it's
			to be expected that equipment will break down or lose efficiency, and that people will forget the good
			habits you worked hard to encourage in the past...
		</p>

		<p>So at a minimum you should take a quick look at your energy data once a week, or even just once a month, to
			ensure that nothing has gone horribly wrong... It's a real shame when easy-to-fix faults such as
			misconfigured timers remain unnoticed for months on end, leaving a huge energy bill that could have easily
			been avoided.</p>

		<p>But ideally your energy-management drive will be an ongoing effort to find new opportunities to target (step
			2), to target them (step 3), and to track your progress at making ongoing energy savings (step 4). Managing
			your energy consumption doesn't have to be a full-time job, but you'll achieve much better results if you
			make it part of your regular routine.</p>
